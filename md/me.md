# Hi thereðŸ––

Iâ€™m Dmitry Rodionov, I build software for Macs.

> Iâ€™m looking for a summer internship position (anything Mac-related) right now. Please, let me know if your companyâ€™s looking for an intern.

### Contracting

Iâ€™m available for OS X consulting/contracting work. Ping me if you need something done on the platform.

Letâ€™s chat [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rodionovme) or [Messages](imessage:i.am.rodionovd@gmal.com). Iâ€™m also open for [emails](mailto:i.am.rodionovd@gmail.com).

### Experience

* **December 2011 â€” now, contractor Mac developer**

    Iâ€™ve been building/fixing system utilities and Cocoa applications for clients.

    Those projects include (among others): network daemons, Mail.app plugins, WebKit-based wrappers, Finder extensions, VPN clients, Accessibility-enabled helpers and automation software.

* **Summer 2015, intern @ Cuckoo Foundation Inc.**

    I was responsible for building an OS X malware analyzer for [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/) as part of my Google Summer of Code project.

    Wrote tons of Python code and put together some tricky DTrace hacks. Source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/rodionovd/cuckoo-osx-analyzer) (**UPD:** *merged into [upsteam](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo) now*).

Iâ€™ve been maintaining a pretty set of open-source libraries and applications. Hereâ€™re my favorites:

* [Daruma](http://internals.exposed/daruma)

  A Mac app for discovering Japanese emoticons the fun way `ãƒ½(=^ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥^=)ä¸¿`. Daruma allows you to search for emoticons by their labels, copy them to the clipboard or just dragâ€™nâ€™drop into other applications like Safari or Messages and many more!

  > Keywords: *NSCollectionView, glyphs cache, text drawing and full keyboard access*.

* [`SWRoute`](https://github.com/rodionovd/SWRoute)  

  A PoC of function hooking in pure Swift.

  > Keywords: *Swift internals, memory manipulations, Swift reverse-engineering, no Objective-C runtime involved*.

* [`liblorgnette`](https://github.com/rodionovd/liblorgnette)  

  Remote symbolication for both OS X and iOS.  

  It works like `dlsym()`, but for any process running on your system.

  > Keywords: *dyld API (process images, building nlists from scratch, symbolication, etc), Mach-O internals*

* [`task_vaccine`](https://github.com/rodionovd/task_vaccine)  

  A lightweight code injection library.  

  > Keywords: *`task_for_pid()`, handling exceptions in a remote process, modifying a thread state, not saying that `mach_inject` is bad, butâ€¦*.

* [Locatr](http://internals.exposed/locatrapp/)  

   A Cocoa app for faking your geolocation on Mac. Wonna tweet from the North Pole? Give it a chance!

  > **UPD:** Locatr has stopped working on El Capitan due to System Integrity Protection restrictions. What a loss!

### Writing & Speaking

I have [a blog](http://internals.exposed) where I share my knowledge about programming, tools and other totally unrelated stuff.

### Education

I'm studying Computer Science in Tomsk State University, B.S. @ 2013â€“2017.
