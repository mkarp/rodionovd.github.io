% Who am I?

Have you ever tried to give a definition of yourself? Remember, for example, the
last time your've been updating your resume or changing your Twitter bio.  
For me, «who am I?» is a tough question and I always struggle to find
*the right* answer.  

I mean, I was asked this question a lot for the last few years (since I've started my
career in programming), and the only answer I've been able to come up with was
something like «a software developer» or «a security researcher» and so — but is it a real *me*?  

Don't think so. These are not *me*, but the stuff *I do* in my
life: like, you now, writing code at work (and sometimes at home), messing around
with reverse-engineering and so.  
Hell, I don't even like coding that much. What I actually like is solving problems
people (myself included) have; figuring out things that are new to me; helping others
to become better at what (I suppose) I'm not bad (it's programming mostly).  

That said, I don't want to define myself as a programmer anymore, simply because
it doesn't feel like the truth. But what's the truth then?  

I'm a *human* after all, not always a nice one, but trying my best to be good and helpful
to others. Why not just stuck with this definition of *me*?  

At the end of the day, our main work is not to write code or draw lines;
it's all about people, treating them well, making their lives a bit better and being
nice to each other.
If a product you've built helps with the points above — that's great! But you still
deal with people, so why differentiate from them by using «developer» or «designer»
badges?

> P.S. btw, welcome to my blog! Don't worry: despite the fact that *I'm not a programmer*,
I'll be posting (mostly) programming stuff here :) — something about Cocoa, maybe Python
(though I'm not any good at it), some OS X and iOS internals, build tools and other stuff.  
Hope you'll enjoy it!
